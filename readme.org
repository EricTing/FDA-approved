*** TODO Filter the unbound proteins

**** Extract the ligand atoms from the CIF files
1. ./script/qmol_CIF2PDB.pl

**** Compare the pdb ligand with drug bank ligand
1. calculate tanimoto coefficient using Kcombu
2. refuse proteins if their ligand's tanimoto < 0.9

*** TODO Cluster the bound proteins based on sequence similarity

**** clean the proteins sequences
1. ctrip
2. ./script/pdb2pdb.pl
   move pdb sequence to start at 1
3. ./script/pdb2fasta.pl
   convert pdb to fasta
4. ./script/fasta2fasta.pl
   break the lines at 80
**** cd-hit to cluster the sequences
